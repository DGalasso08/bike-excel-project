# bike-excel-project


This project outlines the steps I took to clean and analyze data from a bike company. Attached are 2 files: the Excel file containing the raw data, as well as my cleaned data and visualizations in separate sheets, and a text file containing my step by step process for cleaning, analyzing and visualizing the data, as well as insights from the data.

The data is from a YouTube video from Alex the Analyst and is public.
